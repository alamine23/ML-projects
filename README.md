## Hybrid solar/fossil-fuel gas turbine power system
This project focuses on the implementation of a hybrid solar/fossil-fuel gas turbine power system. The following files are included:

- `First_Principles_implementation.ipynb`: This notebook contains the implementation of a first-principles model of the system (neural network designed from scartch).

- `Keras_NN_Prediction.ipynb`: This notebook uses a neural network to predict the performance of the system.

- `Keras_First_Principles_comparison.ipynb`: This notebook compares the results of the neural network and first-principles models.

## Design and control of a solar PV power generation system:

This project focuses on the design and control of a solar PV power generation system. The following files are included:

- `PV_panel_electrical_power_system.ipynb`: This notebook contains the implementation of the NN for optimal mode (configuration) prediction for maximum power output

- `Performance_Solar_PV.ipynb`: This notebook analyzes the performance  of the panel based mainly on data at flux levels below 1300 W/m2, and validate it against data at higher flux
levels. The intent is to then use the model to predict performance of the solar PV panel at higher flux levels that should shift the V-I performance curve to higher current and/or voltage levels.
